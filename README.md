A python library that simulates the control of a memristor circuit on a quantum dot.

More precisely, it simulates the voltage output of a memristor circuit composed of a memristor model following your devices. The resistive value is found using pulsed programming on the memristor model. Then, the stability diagram can be generated from the voltage output, which represents the possible control this circuit can have on a quantum dot.

## Installation

QDMS was developed on python 3.9.5, but could work on other version. To install the library and its dependencies, use:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/3it-nano/QDMS
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the library and all dependencies, use pip-autoremove:
```
pip install pip-autoremove
pip-autoremove qdms -y
pip uninstall pip-autoremove -y
```

To only uninstall the library use:
```
pip uninstall qdms -y
```


## Getting started

To get started with this library, see [Getting Started](https://github.com/Talgarr/TestOfficial/wiki/Getting-started).

## Tests

To run the tests, you need to clone the repository, open the file in terminal and then run:
```
python setup.py pytest
python clear.py
```
clear.py is a script that delete the files and folders created by the tests.
