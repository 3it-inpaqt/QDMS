A python library that simulates the control of a memristor circuit on a quantum dot.

More precisely, it simulates the voltage output of a memristor circuit composed of a memristor model following your devices. The resistive value is found using pulsed programming on the memristor model. Then, the stability diagram can be generated from the voltage output, which represents the possible control this circuit can have on a quantum dot.

## Installation

To install the library and its dependencies, use:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Talgarr/TestOfficial
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the library and all dependencies, use pip-autoremove:
```
pip install pip-autoremove
pip-autoremove qdms -y
pip uninstall pip-autoremove -y
```

To only uninstall the library use:
```
pip uninstall qdms -y
```
